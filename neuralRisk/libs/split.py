split.py:
    This program is used to split CSV or XLSX data into multiple files for
    neural network purposes. Pieces of this code where taken from:
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31112689/shuffle-and-split-a-data-file-into-training-and-test-set
    Usage is split.py <input file> the output will be 3 files
    input_file_name_train,_valid,_test.{csv || xlsx}
    main usage is included in run.py
